This was my first forward attempt at creating a circuit. 
First i familiarized myself with arduino unos and l293d chips.
i started by creating several projects in my tinkercad space.
I also had to familiarize myself with how a breadboard works because it was my first time doing that as well!
I watched many tutorials on youtube for making projects on tinkercad.
while to my surprise I discovered code for the Arduino was similarly based off of the c language i still used the block editor with the text instead of text alone becaue outside of programming with c in second semester, I have never coded before and did not want to mess up in any way. I also did not know how effective the debugging process was on tinkercad and did ot want to risk spending hours simpy trying to figure out what was wrong with my code.
i watched many if not all the video resources provided, skimming through videos because i also had a lot on my plate with school at this time in paticular.
i managed to get both motors running with a switch forward and backward using an if else statement for the switches.
sadly i could not get both motors to rotate in the opposite direction because it seemed like everytime i tried to add this code to the third and fourth switch buttons, the first two incidentally stopped working, so i left them out.
before i go to the dip switch however i learned how to use the potentiometer by watching youtube tutorials.
this was also my first time using github as well, so i apologize if it isn't as visually apealing as is expected.
I hope to further develop my knowledge in using github, in coding and in creating circuitsfor the future!
